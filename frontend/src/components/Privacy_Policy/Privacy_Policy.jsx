                    <br />
                    <br />


                    We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Application, to provide to you the services offered by the Application including to fulfil the orders that you place for products on Format Prints and communicate with you regarding those purchases; resolve service disputes; troubleshoot problems; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, events and updates; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your interests, such as product news; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Service;; provide you with system or administrative messages, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Application usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Application’s content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Application and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Application.

                    <br />

                    What Information Do We Collect?
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    In general, you can browse the Application without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you become a User or purchase products using Format Prints, we require you to provide various contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Application, and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. In addition, as you use the Application, you can from time to time enter or send to us personal information.
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Application for which the information is being collected.
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    We also automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Application. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Application or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Application or not), your computer browser information, your IP address and your location.
                    <br />
                    <br />


                    If you are an End User of our Users’ Portfolios, or you visit Format Prints, we also get information about those interactions, though we use this in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually. We use this data to evaluate, provide, protect or improve our Services (including by developing new products and services).

                    <br />


                    Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services and our Users’ Portfolios. We let our Users control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their Portfolios (except those we need to use to provide the Services properly, such as for performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our Cookie Policy. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.

                    Please be aware that we use cookies and other tracking technologies within the Application to monitor and record any and all activities and communications to, from, and on, the Application in order to safeguard, improve, and analyze usage of, the Application, and for the other purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.

                    We may deploy on our Application certain types of “Non-Cookie Technologies” provided by our service providers to support our digital advertising programs.  These technologies often include browser cache, locally stored objects, or the creation of a statistical identifier wherein an identifier, much like a cookie identifier, is calculated based on the characteristics of a browser or device that distinguishes it from other browsers or devices. These identifiers are calculated either from the data your browser or device shares automatically or with additional data specifically requested from your browser or device. For more information, see https://thenai.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NAI_BeyondCookies_NL.pdf.

                    <br />


                    We also use Twitter’s Conversion Tracking and Tailored Audiences product – by using the Application you are permitting Twitter to collect non-identifying data for analytics purposes. We use this data to improve upon our services and audience; this anonymous data is only used to understand our user base and to assess features and potential advertising content to enhance the Application experience. At no point in time is your personal information tied to this analytics data by Twitter. More information about how you can opt out of this program, including through the Do Not Track functionality in your web browser, is available here.

                    If you use a Third Party Service (such as Google) to register for an Account, the Third Party Service may provide us with your Third Party Service account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address (we don’t store passwords you use to access Third Party Services). Your privacy settings on the Third Party Service normally control what they share with us. Make sure you are comfortable with what they share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the Third Party Service.
